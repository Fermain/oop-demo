# OOP Demo

## Introduction

This repo contains a VERY bare-bones PE1 implementation, allowing for blog posts to be created, deleted, listed and updated. The purpose of this demo is to transform this implementation by using custom classes to centralise API behaviour.

## Extra Goals

- Subtly help with the upcoming CA brief by showing some relevant techniques without spoiling the surprise
- Show some real world regex examples to help with the current module

## Process

1. Look through existing code and make a short manual user demo
2. Pick out some opportunities for improvement with classes
3. Refactor and improve the code to show this approach
